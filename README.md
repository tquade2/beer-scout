### Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application that uses Vue.js for the frontend, C#/.NET for the backend, and SQL for the database. The application is a beer scouting platform where users can view, add, and edit information about beers and breweries.

### Frontend

The frontend of the application is built with Vue.js and is located in the `vue` directory. It uses Vuex for state management, as mentioned in `vue/README.md`. The application's views are located in `vue/src/views` and include pages for viewing, adding, and editing beers and breweries, as well as user registration and login.

### Backend

The backend of the application is built with C#/.NET and is located in the `dotnet` directory. It includes a BeerScout project, as seen in `dotnet/BeerScout/BeerScout.csproj`. The backend handles API requests from the frontend and interacts with the database. It also includes security features, as mentioned in `dotnet/README.md`.

### Database

The database for the application is built with SQL. The SQL script for the database is located in `database/capstone.sql`.

### Development

For development instructions, please refer to the README files in the `vue` and `dotnet` directories.
