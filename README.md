## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) (3.1 or higher)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (14.x or higher)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

### Installation

1. Clone the BeerScout repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beerscout.git
   cd beerscout
   ```

2. Install required Node.js modules:

   ```shell
   cd beerscout-client
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the .NET application:

   ```shell
   cd beerscout-api
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Create the database:

   - Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to execute the SQL scripts provided in the `database-scripts` folder.

5. Configure the application:

   - In the `beerscout-api` folder, locate the `appsettings.json` file and update the database connection string as needed.

6. Start the application:

   - Run the API:

     ```shell
     cd beerscout-api
     dotnet run
     ```

   - Run the client:

     ```shell
     cd beerscout-client
     npm run serve
     ```

7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access BeerScout.

## Project Structure

The BeerScout project has the following structure:

- `beerscout-api`: Contains the .NET Core API for handling beer and brewery data.
- `beerscout-client`: Houses the Vue.js frontend for the BeerScout application.
- `database-scripts`: Includes SQL scripts to create and populate the database.

## Development

During development, you can use the following commands:

- To start the .NET API:

  ```shell
  cd beerscout-api
  dotnet run
  ```

- To start the Vue.js client:

  ```shell
  cd beerscout-client
  npm run serve
  ```

## Database

BeerScout utilizes a T-SQL database to store beer and brewery information. You can find the database schema and sample data in the `database-scripts` folder. To update the database schema, you may need to modify the SQL scripts in this directory.
