  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <div>
      <p>
        BrewScout was born out of a shared love for great beer and a desire to
        make the craft beer experience more accessible to everyone. Taylor,
        Garrett, and Daniel discovered their mutual passion for craft beer
        during their time at Tech Elevator, where they decided to combine their
        skills in web development and their appreciation for the rich tapestry
        of flavors that craft breweries offer.
